## 🖐️ Voice-Gesture Translator (Gesture ↔ Voice Communication Tool)

This project is an AI-powered communication system designed to assist individuals with speech or hearing impairments. It enables **bi-directional translation between hand gestures and voice** using computer vision, deep learning, and speech processing.

### 🚀 Features

#### 🔁 **Gesture to Voice**

* Uses **real-time hand tracking** to detect hand landmarks.
* Classifies hand gestures (ASL signs) using a **CNN-based deep learning model**.
* Converts recognized gestures into **spoken words or sentences** using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**.

#### 🎙️ **Voice to Gesture**

* Captures voice input using speech recognition.
* Translates spoken words into corresponding gestures based on a trained **gesture-generation model** or mapped animations.
* Displays a **virtual hand** or animation performing the matching sign.

#### 🧠 **AI/ML Involvement**

* **CNN** for image-based gesture recognition.
* **Hand landmark detection** powered by computer vision (e.g., MediaPipe or OpenCV).
* **Speech Recognition** using libraries like Google Speech API or Vosk.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding and processing voice commands.
* Optional: RNN/LSTM or Transformers for more advanced language modeling (e.g., phrase-to-gesture mapping).

### 💡 Use Cases

* Helps bridge the communication gap between non-verbal and verbal individuals.
* Useful in accessibility technology, education, and social interaction tools.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe
* TensorFlow / PyTorch (CNN Model)
* gTTS / pyttsx3 for TTS
* SpeechRecognition / Vosk for voice input
* Streamlit / Flask (if there's a web UI)
